# üì∑üöóüì° Exercise 1 ‚Äì Sensor Data Acquisition in CARLA
The goal of this exercise is to implement collect real-time sensor data with our own CARLA client. This setup simulates the data collection scenario that will be followed in posterior exercises to train autonomous driving models.

We focus on collecting data from two sensors:

<div align="center">

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>RGB Camera</strong></td>
    <td align="center"><strong>LIDAR</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/318b869e-dd27-40f7-a803-89766996a967" width="300"/></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aed5d579-8a93-4308-9e9f-ddaa2fba93f3" width="300"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

</div>

Along with the camera and LIDAR images, the script also collects key vehicle state and control information:

- **Throttle**: The acceleration value from the autopilot.
- **Steering**: The current steering angle.
- **Velocity**: The ego vehicle‚Äôs speed in m/s.
- **Indication**: The driving intention sent by the traffic manager (e.g., turn left/right).

This information is recorded at every simulation tick and saved in a CSV file.

# üöó‚áîü§ñ Exercise 2 ‚Äì Integrating CARLA with ROS2
The goal of this exercise is integrating the previous sensor data aquisition into a ROS2 environment.  
The client we implemented in Exercise 1 is adapted to act as a **ROS2 node**, publishing the acquired sensor and vehicle data through ROS2 topics instead of saving them directly to disk.

So the RGB camera, LIDAR and vehicle information are now published, which allows other ROS2 nodes to acces it, being able to visualize it with the `ros_visualize_drive.py` file.

| `rgb_cam`          | `CompressedImage`   | RGB image from front camera                |
| `lidar`            | `PointCloud2`       | Top-down LIDAR scan                        |
| `ego_speed`        | `Vector3Stamped`    | Vehicle speed (x field)                    |
| `ego_acceleration` | `Vector3Stamped`    | Throttle/brake value (x field)             |
| `ego_steering`     | `Vector3Stamped`    | Steering value (z field)                   |
| `tm_action`        | `Vector3Stamped`    | Driving command (z field: 1=Left, 2=Right) |

Additionally it supports the following control modes:

# üöó‚áîüåç Exercise 3 ‚Äì Scenario Generation with Scenic
The goal of this exercise is to generate targeted scenarios using the Scenic language in CARLA to expose failure cases for the CIL++ autonomous driving model. These scenarios simulate challenging edge-case situations that make the model fail. The scenarios with the correct maneuver could then be used to finetune a driving model and help it learn how to deal with these scenarios making the model more rebust.
